What is the goal of the Euclidean distance for the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) machine learning model?

First of all the Euclidean distance or Euclidean distance is a positive mathematical formula that calculates 
the distance of two given points on a plane or in space. And this calculation is based on the Pythagorean theorem.
The objective of this formula is to calculate the distance between two or more study points in order to know their
grouping and distribution. The points can be for example:- people, movies, profiles, songs, or any of the items that the K-NN model is using.

Where, X1, X2 are the coordinates of point P1 and Y1, Y2 are the coordinates of point P2.

The formula asks us for the coordinates of two points, these coordinates can be obtained from two points 
of the K-NN model, after selecting those two points we write them in the formula D (P1 P2) and we are going 
to calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of the coordinates of the two points P1 and P2. the 
result obtained will be the distance between the two points.

here you can see graphically what I mention.

Note: If the Euclidean distance is zero then the points are equal. 
If the Euclidean distance approaches zero then the points are similar. 
If the Euclidean distance is considerable and far from zero then the points are different.
