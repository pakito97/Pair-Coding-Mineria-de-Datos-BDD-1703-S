In the first scatter plot, it is shown that in 1960, approximately ⅓ of the countries have a low fertility rate, but a high life expectancy. On the other hand, the remaining ⅔ has a high fertility rate, but the countries that are in that range, half have a low life expectancy and the other half have a medium life expectancy.

In the 1960 scatter plot grouped by region, it can be seen that the region where the fertility rate is low but its life expectancy is high is that of Europe. It is also possible to observe that several countries in the Americas, Asia and Oceania region have a high fertility rate, but with a medium / high life expectancy. On the other hand, almost all the countries that make up the Africa and Middle East region have a low life expectancy with a high fertility rate.

In the second dispersion graph grouped by country, the relationship between the fertility rate and life expectancy is shown again, but now with the data from 2016. In this graph, compared to the previous ones, a trend is observed where most countries tend towards a high life expectancy, and where the fertility rate decreases. In 2016, it can be seen that approximately ⅔ of the countries have a medium / high life expectancy, they are the countries with the lowest fertility rate, while the rest of the countries that maintain a medium / high fertility rate, have a hope low life.

In the 2013 scatterplot grouped by region, it is clear that the only countries that maintain a low life expectancy with a high fertility rate is Africa. As shown in both scatter charts, although several countries in the region managed to reduce their fertility rates, their life expectancy did not increase, or increased slightly.
The rest of the regions managed to increase their life expectancy and decrease their fertility rate. While most of the countries in the Africa region have a medium life expectancy, the other regions have a high life expectancy.
